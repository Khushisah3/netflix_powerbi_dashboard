Power BI can be used to analyze Netflix Originals data by visualizing trends in genres, ratings, runtimes, and release patterns. After importing and cleaning the data, various visualizations can provide key insights. A bar chart can show the most common genres, while a line chart can track average IMDB ratings over time. Pie charts can represent language distribution, and tables can highlight the highest-rated content. Additionally, histograms or scatter plots can analyze movie runtimes across different genres. Using slicers for filtering by year, genre, or language, along with DAX measures for calculations like average ratings, helps uncover audience preferences and Netflixâ€™s content strategy.
